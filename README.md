# About this repo

This repo contains a technical assignment that I was given when applying for a Data Scientist job.
In a nutshell, there are 3 datasets related to customer loans, and they want to use it to build a prediction for credit score, in order to imporve the risk management strategy of the company.
The assignment is done in Python, and it uses SQL Alchemy library to query the datasets easier.
