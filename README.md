#### This repo contains a technical assignment that I was given when applying for a Data Scientist job.
#### Tl;dr, there are 3 datasets related to customer loans, and they want to use it to build a prediction for credit score, in order to imporve the risk management strategy of the company.
#### The assignment is done in Python, and it uses [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to query the datasets easier. The credit score prediction is done using [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/).
#### The Python notebook is the one named `credit_score_prediction.ipynb`, and the datasets can be found in the `data` directory.
