# Credit Score Prediction

This repository contains the technical assignment for a Data Scientist job, which includes a credit score prediction project.

## Description
The goal of the project is to use three datasets related to customer loans to build a prediction model for credit score. The prediction model will help improve the risk management strategy of the company.

## Tools Used
The project is implemented using Python and [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to query the datasets easier. The credit score prediction model is built using [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/).

## Files
1. `credit_score_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the project.
2. `/data`: The directory containing the three datasets in csv format that are used in the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the `credit_score_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the project.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.x
2. SQL Alchemy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
4. Scikitlearn
3. XGBoost

## Credits
This project was developed by Immanuel Ambhara as part of a technical assignment for a Data Scientist job.
